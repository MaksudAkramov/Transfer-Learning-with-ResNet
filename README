Transfer Learning for ECG Classification Using ResNet

This repository contains both the report and code for a project on ECG image classification using transfer learning with a pre-trained ResNet model. Two approaches were explored:

Fixed Feature Extractor – ResNet layers frozen, only the final layer trained.

Fine-Tuning – Entire model trained for ECG-specific adaptation.

📊 Results

Fixed Feature Extractor: 66.6% accuracy (F1 = 0.666)

Fine-Tuning: 73.5% accuracy (F1 = 0.735)
Fine-tuning provided better feature adaptation but required more computation.

⚙️ Methods

Model: Pre-trained ResNet

Optimizer: Adam (lr = 0.001)

Loss: Cross-Entropy

Epochs: 5

Dataset: 65,600 training and 18,136 testing ECG images (balanced classes)
